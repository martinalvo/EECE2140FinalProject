This project consists of an unmanned physics simulation of a fluid. This simulation is meant to be interactive, although this function will be limited, so that the user can play around with the fluid, and maybe even change it's color. This simulation is done using pygame and numpy to create particles that are affected by gravity, density, and pressure forces, utilizing knowledge of vector mathematics.
